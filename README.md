# Up and Go BBQ

## Background
Up and Go BBQ is a small business run by Vaughan Johnson. Vaughan is from Detroit, and makes BBQ in the Detroit style. He is currently selling his food at the corner of Nolensville and Harding Place in Nashville, TN.

I met Vaughan while he was handing out fliers for his business. I did an initial consultation to discuss with him what would go into a website. I met him on location and took photos for the site.
